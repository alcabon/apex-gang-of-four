# proxy pattern

Provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.

In this example, we model an ATM machine. An ATM has many features, but only a handful of them are available to a banking customer. This Proxy ensures that only specific features are exposed publicly to the customer.
