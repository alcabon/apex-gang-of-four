# command pattern

The Command Pattern creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.

The example here uses a Television Remote that can interface with a Television or DVD Player. Buttons on the remote issue commands, these commands vary by the device the remote is interfaced with. Ex: Pressing left arrow button on the remote has two separate actions depending on whether it is connected to a Television or a DVD Player.
